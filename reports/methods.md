## DATASET

The dataset used comprises of 312 instances of English sentences and their corresponding DAIDE translations, found here: https://github.com/ALLAN-DIP/diplomacy_translation/tree/main/data. It is a subset of the larger `smosher` dataset found here: https://github.com/isi-nlp/DiplomacyAMR/tree/main/annotations. 

* 283 of these English messages appear in their entirety within the larger dataset
* 20 of these English messages are a part of a message that appears within the larger dataset
* The remaining 9 English messages are simple orders:
  * Germany, Austria and Italy are allies against France and Russia.
  * We propose an alliance between Germany, Austria and Italy against France and Russia.
  * the Italian fleet in Venice
  * Move the French fleet on the north coast of Spain to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.
  * Build a Russian army in Moscow.
  * We propose peace between England, France and Germany.
  * We accept the peace proposal between England, France and Germany.
  * Retreat the Italian army from Greece to Albania.
  * Let the French fleet in the English Channel support the French army in Belgium.

Most experimentation was performed using a subset of 100 instances, sampled randomly from the 312 instances without replacement. When obtaining results, post-processing was performed to remove any extraneous characters (such as newline characters commonly generated by GPT-3).

### Possible Issues

The dataset contains possible issues. In particular, the lack of gold DAIDE may prove to be a hindrance when analysing results. Currently, the "gold" DAIDE used is a result of rule-based translation from AMR to DAIDE, with (presumably) some human checks to ensure that the DAIDE is full-DAIDE and is correct.

#### Duplicates

Of particular note are several instances of duplicates within the dataset.

* There exist 3 instances of the English message "Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys  dmz'd if that's ok with you?" which have 2 different translations:
  * 2 translation of "PRP (DMZ (FRA ITA) (PIE LYO WES TYS))"
  * 1 translation of "PRP (DMZ (FRA ITA) (PIE WES))"
* There exist 2 instances of the English message "Hi Turkey! I fully agree that we should stay peaceful with eachother. How do you like the sound of you getting Greece and Bulgaria and I'll go for Romania and Serbia?" with 2 different translations:
  * 1 translation of "YES (PRP (PCE (AUS TUR)))"
  * 1 translation of "PRP (SCD (TUR GRE BUL) (AUS RUM SER))"

In the former case, there appears to be a mistranslation in the second translation instance. In the latter case, the DAIDE messages appear to represent different parts of the English message, with the first translation representing the first part of the message, and the second translation representing the second part of the message. 

#### Split up messages

When assigning the corresponding DAIDE translations to the split up messages, the DAIDE translations appear to have been swapped in one instance. Within the larger dataset is this message:

* "how do we  bring him down?  austria is talking to me about the same thing" from England to Italy, DAIDE is "AND (PRP (ALY (AUS ENG) VSS (GER))) (PRP (ALY (ENG ITA) VSS (GER)))"

Within this dataset, the DAIDE has been incorrectly assigned:

* "how do we  bring him down?" = "PRP (ALY (AUS ENG) VSS (GER))", and 
* "austria is talking to me about the same thing" = "PRP (ALY (ENG ITA) VSS (GER))"

Manual checking of the other 18 split up messages reveals only issues in this particular instance.
